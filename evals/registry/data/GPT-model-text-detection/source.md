**Extract from "VILLA RUBEIN, A NOVEL" by JOHN SINJOHN:**

"He ran up the uncarpeted stairs. Dawney followed; with thumbs hooked in the arm-holes of his waistcoat and head thrown back he mounted slowly. In an attic, which occupied the entire top storey, Harz had already pulled a canvas in front of the window. He was a young man of medium height, square shouldered and active, with an angular face, rather high cheek bones, and a strong, sharp chin. His eyes were steel blue under very flexible eyebrows, his nose long and thin with a high bridge. Dark, unparted hair fitted his head like a cap. He was a type of the Condottiere, but for his brow, which was that of an idealist. His clothes were the clothes of a man who never gave them a second thought."

**Extract from "THE Life of the Fields" By RICHARD JEFFERIES:**

"So fair a complexion could not brown even in summer, exposed to the utmost heat. The beams indeed did heighten the hue of her cheeks a little, but it did not shade to brown. Her chin and neck were wholly untanned, white and soft, and the blue veins roamed at their will. Lips red, a little full perhaps ; teeth slightly prominent but white and gleamy as she smiled. Dark brown hair in no great abundance, always slipping out of its confinement and straggling, now on her forehead, and now on her shoulders, like wandering bines of bryony. The softest of brown eyes under long eyelashes ; eyes that seemed to see everything in its gentlest aspect, that could see no harm anywhere. A ready smile on the face, and a smile in the form. Her shape yielded so easily at each movement that it seemed to smile as she walked. Her nose was the least pleasing feature — not delicate enough to fit with the complexion, and distinctly upturned, though not offensively."

**Extract from "Stories of the Steppe" by Maxim Gorki:**

"He seemed utterly unconscious of the cold blasts of the wind that whipped open his gypsy cloak, exposing and lashing unmercifully his hairy bronze-colored chest. Turning toward me his free, vStrong and handsome face from his recumbent posture, he thouglitfully puffed away at his big pipe, blowing thick clouds of smoke from his mouth and nostrils. His motionless eyes were fixed beyond me upon the darkness that stretched endlessly over the death-like silence of the steppe. He talked to me without interruption, making no motion whatsoever to shield himself against the pitiless buffeting of the storm."

**Extract from "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee:**

""Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing." Scout Finch, the narrator of the story, reflected on her childhood as she recalled her father's words. Set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Great Depression, the story unfolded through Scout's innocent eyes. The small southern town seemed caught in a time warp, and Scout's father, Atticus Finch, a widowed lawyer, stood as a beacon of reason in the midst of prejudice and injustice. Scout and her older brother Jem were exposed to the racial tensions that simmered in Maycomb, leading them to question the world around them.."

**Extract from "1984" by George Orwell:**

"Winston Smith knew he was taking an enormous risk by penning his thoughts in a diary, a forbidden act in the totalitarian regime of Oceania. As he wrote, his heart pounded with the fear of being caught. The world around him was bleak and oppressive, ruled by Big Brother, the embodiment of the Party's all-seeing and all-knowing presence. The cityscape of London, renamed Airstrip One, lay under the heavy shadow of constant surveillance. The Party's slogans were plastered everywhere, reminding the citizens that "Big Brother is Watching You" and that "War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength." The Party sought to control not just their actions but their very thoughts, erasing individuality and enforcing conformity."

**Extract from "LETTERS TO THE WORKMEN AND LABOURERS OF GREAT BRITAIN" by JOHN RUSKIN:**

"Now, though I am an lUiberal, there are many things I should like to destroy. I should like to destroy most of the railroads in England, and all the railroads in Wales. I should like to destroy and rebuild the Houses of Parliament, the National Gallery, and the East end of London; and to destroy, without rebuilding, the new town of Edinburgh, the north suburb of Geneva, and the city of New York. Thus in many things I am the reverse of Conservative; nay, there are some long-established things which I hope to see changed before I die; but I want still to keep the fields of England green, and her cheeks red ; and that girls should be taught to curtsey, and boys to take their hats off, when a Professor or otherwise dignified person passes by; and that Kings should keep their crowns on their heads, and Bishops their crosiers in their hands ; and should duly recognise the significance of the crown, and the use of the crook."

**Extract from "FAUST" By JOHANN WOLFGANG von GOETHE:**

"In the sixteenth century the Magus-legend became asso¬ ciated with Faust, who may be considered first as an histor¬ ical, and then as a legendary personage, and finally as the hero of German popular literature. Magic, nothwithstanding its supposed diabolical character, being held in high esteem in the sixteenth century, its votaries formed a numerous class, embracing men of every variety of culture, from students like Agrippa and Paracelsus, down to the mounte¬ bank and quack. One of these individuals, in whose person the features of popular magic were strikingly exhib¬ ited, left behind him an enduring name which became associated with the mediaeval Magus-legend."

**Extract from "THE WORKS OF JACK LONDON" by MARTIN EDEN:**

"An oil painting caught and held him. A heavy surf thundered and burst over an outjutting rock; lowering storm-clouds covered the sky; and, outside the line of surf, a pilot-schooner, close-hauled, heeled over till every detail of her deck was visible, was surging along against a stormy sunset sky. There was beauty, and it drew him irresistibly. He forgot his awkward walk and came closer to the painting, very close. The beauty faded out of the canvas. His face expressed his bepuzzlement. He stared at what seemed a careless daub of paint, then stepped away. Immediately all the beauty flashed back into the canvas. "A trick picture," was his thought, as he dismissed it, though in the midst of the multitudinous impressions he was receiving he found time to feel a prod of indignation that so much beauty should be sacrificed to make a trick. He did not know painting. (He had been brought up on chromos and lithographs that were always definite and sharp, near or far.) He had seen oil paintings, it was true, in the show windows of shops, but the glass of the windows had prevented his eager eyes from approaching too near."

**Extract from "THE MONK" By M. G. lewis, Esq., M.P:**

"As she spoke, her eyes filled with a delicious langour : her bosom panted : she twined her arms voluptuously round him, drew him towards her, and glued her lips to his. Ambrosio again raged with desire : the die was thrown : his vows were already broken : he had already committed the crime, and why should he refrain from enjoying its reward? He clasped her to his breast with redoubled ardour. No longer repressed by the sense of shame, he gave a loose to his intemperate appetites; while the fair wanton put every invention of lust in practice, every refinement in the art of pleasure, which might heighten the bliss of her possession, and render her lover's transports still more exquisite. Ambrosio rioted in delights till then unknown to him. Swift fled the night, and the morning blushed to behold him still clasped in the embraces of Matilda."

**Extract from "THE BIG BLUE SOLDIER" by GRACE LIVINGSTON HILL:**

"A neat paragraph to that effect ap¬ peared in The Springhaven Chronicle, a local sheet that offered scant news items and fat platitudes at an ever-increasing rate to a gullible and conceited popu¬ lace, who supported it because it was really the only way to know what one’s neighbors were doing. The paragraph was the reluctant work of Mary Amber, the young girl who lived next door to Miss Marilla and had been her devoted Mary Amber remembered Nephew Dick as a young imp of nine who made a whole long, beautiful summer ugly with his torments. She also knew that the neighbors all round about had mem¬ ories of that summer when Dick’s parents went on a Western trip and left him with his Aunt Marilla. Mary Amber shrank from exposing her dear friend to the criticisms of such of the readers of The Springliaven Chronicle as had memories of their cats tortured, their chickens chased, their flower-beds trampled, their children bullied, and their windows broken by the youthful Dick.
